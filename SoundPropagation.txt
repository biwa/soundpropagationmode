Sound Propagation Mode Plugin (version 1.0.0)
---------------------------------------------

This plugin adds a two modes to GZDoom Builder. 


Sound Propagation Mode
----------------------
This mode shows how sound propagates from the currently highlighted sector
through the map.

Following colors are used:

* dark green: the currently highlighted sector
* light green: sounds can travel unhindered to these sectors
* yellow: these sectors are behind a sound blocking line, but sound will
  still travel to this sector from the highlighted sector
* gray: sounds from the highlighted sector will not travel to these sectors
* red: these lines have the block sound flag set


ZDoom Sound Environment Mode
----------------------------
This mode shows the sound environments in ZDoom maps (both Hexen format and
UDMF). The gray areas do not belong to a sound environment.

The mode also supplies a docker that supplies information about the sound
environments. It will display the sound environments, the SoundEnvironment
things belonging to them and also the lines that are limit the sound
environments. Clicking on the sound environments, things or lines in the list
will center the map view on those objects.

This mode can also help you find problems (i.e. behavior that you probably that
you probably did not intend). If there are any problems with a sound
environment a warning sign will displayed in the list at the affected thing or
line (the icon will bubble up the tree to make it easier to find when the whole
list is collapsed).

Following problems are detected:
- One-sided lines that are set to be a sound zone boundary
- Two-sided lines that are set to be a sound zone boundary, but the sectors on
  both sides belong to the  same sound environment
- Multiple non-dormant SoundEnivornment things

Note that the latter two can be caused by sound environments unintentionally
bleeding into other sectors (i.e. not correctly sealed sound environments).


Installation
------------
Simply copy the SoundPropagation.dll into the Plugins folder in your GZDB
installation folder.

Version History
---------------
1.0.0 (2015-xx-xx)
	- Changed the ways linedefs are drawn in both modes. They now ignore any
	  special coloring (like line specials, 3D floors etc.), so it's easier
	  to see the important information
	- Fixed a bug in Sound Environment Mode, where the map would zoom to the
	  first sound environment, when the Sound Environment docker is not
	  pinned and shown for the first time
	- Fixed problems when opening another map from the same WAD while being in
	  Sound Propagation Mode or Sound Environment Mode
	- Discovering sound environments now works asynchronously. This does not
	  increase performance, but the UI stays responsive while the map is
	  processed. The mode also tries to process sound environments close to
	  your current view first.
	  Sound environments may have gaps in numbering. This is nothing to worry
	  about, it's not missing any sound environments
	- In Sound Propagation Mode sectors are now combined into sound propagation
	  domains (where sound will always be propagated freely). This is a big
	  increase in performance for complex maps. Visually nothing changed
	  
0.9.3 (2015-01-07)
	- Added ZDoom sound environment mode
	- Things that are in the affected sectors and don't have the deaf/ambush
	  flag set (i.e. monsters that will come for the player when they hear
	  him/her) are now displayed solidly
	- Thing filters are now taken into account 
	  
0.9.2 (2015-01-04)
	- Fixed dates in SoundPropagation.txt file (to YYYY-MM-DD)
	- Added color configuration dialog (accessible from the tool bar when
	  in Sound Propagation Mode
	- Removed some unused code
	
0.9.1 (2015-01-03)
	- Fixed a typo in SoundPropagation.txt
	- Fixed a bug where sound would propagate through sectors even
	  though their heights should not allow it
	  
0.9.0 (2015-01-03)
	- First release
