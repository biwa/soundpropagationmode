Sound Propagation Mode Plugin (version 0.9.1)
-------------------------------------------

This plugin adds a new mode to GZDoom Builder. This mode shows how sound
propagates from the currently highlighted sector through the map.

Following colors are used:

* dark green: the currently highlighted sector
* light green: sounds can travel unhindered to these sectors
* yellow: these sectors are behind a sound blocking line, but sound will
  still travel to this sector from the highlighted sector
* gray: sounds from the highlighted sector will not travel to these sectors
* red: these lines have the block sound flag set



Installation
------------
Simply copy the SoundPropagation.dll into the Plugins folder in your GZDB
installation folder.
